                <P>
                        The PuTTY executables and source code are distributed under the MIT licence, which is simil
                        ar in effect to the BSD licence. (This licence is Open Source certified and complies with 
                        the Debian Free Software Guidelines.)<br>
                        The precise licence text, as given in the About box and in the file LICENCE in the source 
                        distribution, is as follows:

                <p>In particular, anybody (even companies) can use PuTTY without restriction (even for commercial purposes) and owe nothing to us, or to anybody else. Also, apart from having to maintain the copyright notice and the licence text in derivative products, anybody (even companies) can adapt the PuTTY source code into their own programs and products (even commercial products) and owe nothing to us or anybody else. And, of course, there is no warranty and if PuTTY causes you damage you're on your own, so don't use it if you're unhappy with that.<br><br>

                        In particular, note that the MIT licence is compatible with the GNU GPL. So if you want to incorporate PuTTY or pieces of PuTTY into a GPL program, there's no problem with that.</p>

                <p><b>LEGAL WARNING:</b> Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where encryption
