Creative Portion: 
1. Tags can be added to events and are displayed accordingly on the calendar. The tags are color coded and the events show up as the same color. 
2. Events can be shared to other users by typing their username in the box and then clicking on the share button next to the event. It then shows up on both of their calendar.
